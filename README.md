# Infinite pagination to Windowed Pagination using Relay

More details in [this](https://www.aamirj.com/posts/2021-12-11-windowed-pagination-with-relay) blog post. 

This example mocks the data layer with some user objects and shows how we can implement infinite pagination with them and also windowed pagination, both using Relay. Note that this is simply one way of approaching this problem.

Built using create-react-app (ejected), graphql-tools (for the mock schema), and apollo (for easy interaction with graphql).
